Tell AI crawlers that they shouldn't access your site.

== Description ==

Long description

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

The plugin adds directives to the `robots.txt` file to tell AI crawlers that they shouldn't index your site. It also adds the `noai` meta tag to your site's header to do the same.

= What if I already have a `robots.txt` file on my web server? =

If you have a physical `robots.txt` file on your web server, you won't be able to activate this plugin. The plugin only works when using WordPress' built-in virtual `robots.txt`.

= Will this work with other plugins that modify the virtual `robots.txt`? =

It should in theory. It just appends the directives to the `robots.txt` file.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
